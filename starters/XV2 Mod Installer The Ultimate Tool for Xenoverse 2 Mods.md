## How to Download and Install XV2 Mods Installer
 
Before you can use XV2 Mods Installer, you need to have XV2Patcher installed. This is a tool that includes a series of patches for Xenoverse 2, such as allowing files to be loaded from data, allowing more character, skills, stages, etc. You can download the latest version of XV2Patcher [here](https://animegamemods.freeforums.net/thread/701/tools-eternity). Extract the contents of the zip file into your game directory (where DBXV2.exe is located).
 
Next, you need to download XV2 Mods Installer itself. You can find the latest version [here](https://animegamemods.freeforums.net/thread/821/xv2-mods-installer). Extract the contents of the zip file into any folder you want. Run XV2 Mods Installer.exe as administrator. If you have an original game, the program should be able to find out the requirements on its own and won't bother you. Otherwise, the program will prompt you to locate the file DBXV2.exe (make sure that DBXV2.exe you choose is from the bin folder and not anywhere else).
 
That's it! You have successfully installed XV2 Mods Installer. Now you can use it to install mods for Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
